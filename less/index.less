// Follow the order in the readme

/* 
Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git
 DONE Create a forked copy of this project.
 DONE Add your team lead as collaborator on Github.
 DONE Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Lambda's by mistake!).
 DONE Create a new branch: git checkout -b <firstName-lastName>.
 Implement the project on your newly created <firstName-lastName> branch, committing changes regularly.
 Push commits: git push origin <firstName-lastName>.
Follow these steps for completing your project.

 Submit a Pull-Request to merge Branch into master (student's Repo). Please don't merge your own pull request
 Add your team lead as a reviewer on the pull-request
 Your team lead will count the project as complete by merging the branch back into master.

 Task 2: Set up your preprocessor
 DONE Verify that you have LESS installed correctly by running lessc -v in your terminal, if you don't get a version message back, reach out to your team lead for help.
 DONE Open your terminal and navigate to your preprocessing project by using the cd command
 DONE Once in your project's root folder, run the following command less-watch-compiler less css index.less
 DONE Verify your compiler is working correctly by changing the background-color on the html selector to red in your index.less file.
 Once you see the red screen, you can delete that style and you're ready to start on the next task

 Task 3: Import LESS Files
 DONE Navigate to your index.less file. Notice the file is blank. In order for you to see the styles for this project you must import them in a certain order. That order is as follows:
  variables.less
  mixins.less
  reset.less
  global.less
  navigation.less
  footer.less
  home-page.less
Task 4: Desktop Updates Needed
 Review the desktop design file. Notice the navigation, header, and buttons at the bottom of the page are missing. ** HTML Added 
 DONE Navigation: Use the navigation.less file for all your navigation styling
 DONE Main Header: Use the home-page.less file for the header styling.
 DONE Buttons: Create a parametric mixin that can create the missing buttons in the design file. Use the mixins.less file to create your mixin.
Task 5: Mobile Updates Needed
 DONE Use escaping to create a variable named @mobile that contains this value: (max-width: 500px). Use the variables.less file to house your variables.
 DONE Review the mobile design file. You will see several design updates that need updating.
 DONE Match the design file at 500px as well as you can
Stretch Goals:
 Create an animation mixin using parametric mixins
 DONE Introduce a form with inputs allowing users to select a vacation package and a submit button at the bottom of the page. Introduce inputs for name, email, phone number, and an area for them to leave special instructions.
 DONE Style the site to look good at all sizes, not just desktop and phone */
